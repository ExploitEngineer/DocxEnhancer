## Things which you have to know when using openai API

# 🧠 1. What is Assistant ?

## Definition

`An assistant is a custom versoin of ChatGPT that you've configured for a specific task. Think of it like a tailored chatbot or agent that has its own:`

- Instructions (behavior/personality/goals).
- Tools (like code interpreter, retrival, or your own APIs).
- Files (optional context).
- Model (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, etc).

`Once you create an Assistant, it gets a persistent ID - you reuse that assistant anytime you want that behavior.`

# 🧵 2. What is a Thread ?

## Definition

`A Thread is a conversation between a user and an assistant. It stores:`

- All messages (user + assistant)
- All runs (calls to GPT to generate response)

### 🔁 Why you need Threads

`Each user can have multiple sessions, and Threads help you:`

- Separate conversations
- Resume them later
- Keep context over time

# 🚀 3. What is Run ?

## Definition

`A Run is an event that triggers the Assistant to process the messages in a Thread and respond.`

> It's like saying: "Hey assistant, process this conversation and reply."

### 🧭 Internally, a Run does

- Checks the Assistant's settings
- Reads the current Thread
- Calls the model (like GPT-4) 
- Sends back the Assistant's reply

# 💬 4. What are Messages ?

## Definition

`Messages are the individual chat messages in a Thread.`

- A message has a `role`: either `user` or `assistant`
- A message has `content`: the text (or files, in advanced cases)

### 🧱 Messages Stack

`Let’s say you want to chat with the assistant about JavaScript:`

1. You add a message: "Explain closures in JavaScript"
2. You start a run -> assistant reads all messages
3. It replies with an explanation -> new assistant message is added
